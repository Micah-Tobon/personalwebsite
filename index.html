    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently an undergraduate student at Ohio University who is pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics. I successfully completed my freshman year at the Russ College of Engineering and Technology at OU with a 4.00 GPA. Being above a 3.5 GPA, I was placed on the Dean's list, which identifies the top 15% of my class. I am employed by Ohio University's Housing and Residential Life as a Resident Assistant for first-year students, with whom I work closely to ensure a positive transition to college. I was also accepted to Alpha Lambda Delta (ALD) Honors Society, a prestigious organization run by the Dean of Students. I am a member of OMSAR (Office for Multicultural Student Access and Retention) which is an on-campus group committed to enhancing the college experience and the success for culturally diverse students. Additionally, I am an active member of the Association of Computer Machinery (ACM) which is a professional organization that participates in programming events throughout the Midwest. I dedicated this past summer to self-teaching application development utilizing the Swift language. I have an interest in software development and currently looking for a co-op or internship for Summer 2019.
